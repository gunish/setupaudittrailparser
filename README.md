Setup Audit Trail Parser
======

This is a small windows based (desktop) application that can produce a summary of changes which have been done over a given period of time by a given number of users.
Simply supply the program with a SetupAudit Trail and it will use intelligent parsing to convert the bloated log into meaningfull data that can be use for deriving a ChangeControl Log, or a Checklist for items that have been changed.
This kind of a report can prove to be quite beneficial, while doing release management.
